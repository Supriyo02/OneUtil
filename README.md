## Key Features:
* User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and securely manage their profiles using bcryptjs for password hashing and session cookies for authentication.
* Service Creation and Management: Users can create their own services, providing detailed information such as service type, price, location, category, facilities, and images. They can also edit and manage their existing services.
* Search and Filtering: The application offers advanced search and filtering capabilities, allowing users to find services based on location, service type, rating, price, and other criteria.
* Booking and Payment: Users can book a service for a specific date and time. The booking process includes payment integration using Stripe for secure transactions.
* Booking Management: Both users and service providers can view and manage their booked services, including confirmation details and status.
* Error Handling: The backend API incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to prevent crashes and provide informative error messages to users.
* Data Storage: MongoDB is used to store user data, service information, and booking details in a secure and scalable manner.
* Frontend Development: The frontend is built using React, providing a modern and interactive user interface. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, and React Router Dom for navigation between different pages.
* Testing: The application undergoes thorough end-to-end testing using Playwright to ensure quality and prevent bugs.
* Deployment: The final product is deployed on Render for easy access and availability.
